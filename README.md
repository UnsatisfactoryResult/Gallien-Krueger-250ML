# Gallien-Krueger-250ML
Gallien-Krueger's 250ML is a small 2 channel stereo solid state 100 watt guitar combo amp with 2 6.5" speakers. It is amazingly full featured with the following:
* dual channels
* compressor on channel A
* 4 band eq
* stereo echo and chorus effects
* foot switch port
* headphone out
* left and right external speaker outputs
* ability to diable onboard speakers
* send and return ports
* and a stereo aux in

The PCB is not marked, yay! I uploaded a capacitor map, and I will update the picture with the correct designations shortly. Strangely, the service manual calls for all the 3.3uF capacitors to be 50v, and I have a couple that are 25v. My personal amp is 40 years old and still kicking, but if you're servicing one I would go with 50v for all those little guys.

Both channels have a gain switch, not a knob. You can adjust the gain of the switch though. The service manual has instructions to do so.
